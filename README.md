# Titanic Survival Predictor 🚢

This is my first machine learning project, based on Kaggle’s Titanic competition. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using data science and machine learning techniques.

## 🔍 What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset
- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Fare`
- Converted categorical variables like `Sex` and `Embarked` to numeric
- Explored survival patterns using visualizations
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Achieved **76.3% accuracy** on the Kaggle public leaderboard

- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Full notebook with code and analysis
- `titanic_submission.csv`: Final prediction file submitted to Kaggle
- `README.md`: This file

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Kaggle (for dataset & competition platform)

## 🏁 Next Steps

- Try other models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Create new features (e.g. Title from name, FamilySize)
- Use cross-validation for better evaluation
- Learn hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy
